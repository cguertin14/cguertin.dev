## First things first

So... here we go. This is officially my first post on this website and I'm pretty excited!
I've been thinking about doing this project for a long time and now I'm officially doing it, and it feels good.
Also, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Charles, I live in Montreal, I'm currently a 3rd year student at Ã‰TS in *Software Engineering*
and I work as an Online Programmer for Ubisoft, in the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) division.

## Why am I doing a blog?

Why am I doing a blog? Well, like many other tech enthusiasts, I do love to experience new technologies... only all the time. So,
I built this website with a simple goal in mind: document my experiences & findings. This blog will basically be a portfolio of what I do.

## Where is this website running?

Glad you ask. This blog actually runs on my personal homelab on a Kubernetes Cluster (which I'll describe in a future article). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/cguertin14/cguertin.dev). I built this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).


## Conclusion

In conclusion, I truly hope you'll find some interest in what I'll be writing on here. Here's to many more tech-related articles.
