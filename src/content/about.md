## Charles Guertin

Charles Guertin, from Montréal (Québec, Canada), graduate in Software Engineering @ ÉTS Montréal (B. Eng). I speak fluently in both French :fr: and English :uk:. Montréal Canadiens :ice_hockey: and New England Patriots :football: fan. I try to travel whenever I can. I also enjoy reading books of all kinds and listening to all genres of music on my turntable.

## Professional Experience

I currently work as a Senior Site Reliability Expert (SRE) for the Lightspeed Commerce organization. I specialize in distributed systems (mostly Kubernetes), automation and programming involving Go -- my language of choice. In the past, I have worked for several companies, including big, medium and small ones, where I developed different sets of skills & tackled on challenging projects.

## Volunteering

When I arrived at ÉTS in September of 2018, I joined an open source student club called [CEDILLE](https://cedille.etsmtl.ca). I was later voted **Captain** of the club in October 2019, a position I held for two years. Since then, we as a club have accomplished a lot. From growing plants using Raspberry Pis, to deploying & managing a production infrastructure on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). As Captain, my role consisted of leading members through their projects, recruiting and training new members, negociating contracts with sponsors, organizing club activities, etc. It was definitely not easy, combined with a part-time job and full time studies, but I'm super grateful for the opportunity to have had this role. If it weren't for CEDILLE, I probably wouldn't have specialized in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
