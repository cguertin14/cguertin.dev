## :ice_hockey_stick_and_puck: Charles Guertin

Charles Guertin, from Montréal (Québec, Canada), currently an undergraduate student in Software Engineering @ ÉTS Montréal. I speak fluently in both French :fr: and English :uk:. I'm a *big* Montréal Canadiens fan (GO HABS GO!). I try to travel whenever I can, that means pretty much every year, except for 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I also enjoy reading books of all kinds and listening to all genres of music on my turntable.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Work 

I currently work at Ubisoft Montréal as an Online Programmer in the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) division. I specialize in distributed systems (mostly Kubernetes), automation and programming involving Go -- my language of choice. In the past, I have worked for several companies, including a few startups, where I developed different sets of skills.

## :man-raising-hand: Volunteering

Since I arrived at ÉTS, I joined an open source student club called [CEDILLE](https://cedille.etsmtl.ca). I've been a member since September 2018 and was voted **Captain** in October 2019, a position I still hold to this day. Since then, we as a club have accomplished a lot. From growing plants using Raspberry Pi, to deploying & managing a production infrastructure on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). As The Captain, my role consists of leading members through their projects, recruiting and training new members, negociating contracts with sponsors, organizing Club activities, etc. It is definitely not easy, combined with a part-time job and full time studies, but I'm super grateful for the opportunity to have this role. If it weren't for CEDILLE, I probably wouldn't have specialized in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
