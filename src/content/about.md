## Charles Guertin

I'm from Montréal, Québec, Canada. Graduate in Software Engineering @ ÉTS Montréal (B. Eng), I speak fluently in both French and English. I love to travel, spend quality time with my family, work on my homelab & fix stuff around the house. I also enjoy reading books of all kinds and listening to music on my turntable. Lately, I've gotten into photography, which has been really fun.

## Professional Experience

I currently work as a Senior Site Reliability Expert (SRE) for the Lightspeed Commerce organization. I specialize in distributed systems (mostly Kubernetes), automation and programming involving Go. In the past, I have worked for several companies, including big, medium and small ones, where I developed different sets of skills & where I tackled challenging projects.

## Personal Projects

My never-ending homelab evolution can be traced down to the two projects below:
* [infra](https://github.com/cguertin14/infra) which is my personal homelab infrastructure running on [k3s](https://k3s.io)
* [k3s-ansible-ha](https://github.com/cguertin14/k3s-ansible-ha) which is a collection of Ansible playbooks for my Homelab
